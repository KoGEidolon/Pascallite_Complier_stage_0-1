# Pascallite Complier stage 0 - 1

- This is a team project for class CS 4301 - Angelo State University - A Pascallite Complier including stage 0 - 1 - this is meant for educational purpose only.

- Why use Visual Studio here? Helps a lot with the debugging (F5) process, and make use of the intellisense in the IDE.

- In case the Visual Studio did not configure itself, go to Project Property -> Linker -> System -> change the SubSystem setting into Console(/SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE) (since we are using main(int argc, char** argv))

- Add the .dat file to the project folder, change the execute command in Project Property -> Configuration Properties -> Debugging -> change the command arguments into .dat .lst .asm. A example of 001.dat 001.lst 001.asm has been added. You will have to add the test database yourself.
